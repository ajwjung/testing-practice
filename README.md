# Testing Practice

## Objective

To practice Test Driven Development (TDD) by writing tests using Jest. Full details can be found on [The Odin Project's page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-testing-practice).

**Assignment**

Write tests for the following:

1. A `capitalize` function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized

2. A `reverseString` function that takes a string and returns it reversed

3. A `calculator` object that contains functions for the basic operations: `add`, `subtract`, `divide`, and `multiply`. Each of those functions should take two numbers and return the correct calculation

4. A `caesarCipher` function that takes a string and a shift factor and returns it with each character “shifted” ([more details here](http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/caesar-cipher/))

5. An `analyzeArray` function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties: `average`, `min`, `max`, and `length`
